## Overview

This project leverages **Power BI** to provide comprehensive analytics for a supply chain, covering multiple dimensions such as inventory levels, revenue, profit, and order progress. The dashboard visualizes key metrics and trends, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize supply chain operations.

## Project Features

- **Revenue and Cost Analysis**: Breakdown of revenue and cost by order and procurement dates, showing financial performance trends over time.
  
- **Inventory Order Level Analysis**: Visualization of inventory levels in progress, tracking items from procurement to delivery, which helps in efficient stock management.
  
- **Profit and Profit Margin**: Analysis of total profit and profit margin percentage over selected periods, identifying high-profit products and overall profitability trends.
  
- **Order Progress by Warehouse**: Insight into order status across warehouses, helping to manage and prioritize order fulfillment.
  
- **Revenue by Channel**: Distribution of revenue across different channels (e.g., Wholesale, Distributor, Export), providing insights into the performance of each sales channel.

## Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes various charts and graphs for an intuitive and interactive user experience, including:

- **Revenue and Cost Trends**: Line charts depicting trends in revenue and costs over time, segmented by quarters and years.
  
- **Top Products by Profit**: Bar charts highlighting the top-performing products by profit, enabling a focus on high-margin items.
  
- **Inventory Levels Over Time**: Line graphs tracking inventory in progress, helping to predict potential stockouts or excess inventory situations.
